# Company of Heores 3 Data
Data and icons on all Company of Heroes 3 units / stuff in a developer friendly format.

## Goal 
Goal of this repository is to gather all the data from the game Comapny of Heroes 3. For example data for all units. As well as tools and scripts for gathering this data from the game. We beliave that open sourcing all the data and tools can only help the game and community.
Once we have the data it's up to anyone to build any web-site or apps and work with this data. But let's put all our heads together 

## Convention
- All the data should be converted into .json files
- Please provide all the scripts / add manuals how you get the data
   - We can expect a lot of updates from developers. So we will need to run our scripts many times.
- We shall do git tags to mark patch changes 

## Contribution 
We are looking for more help! If you would like to contribute in any way. Please rech out ot us here in the issues / on the discord https://discord.gg/jRrnwqMfkr
